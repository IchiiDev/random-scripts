# Random Scripts
A few scripts I created when I needed them, or because I was bored.  

### CVE-2016-5195.sh
Hot-patch for the Linux Kernel DirtyCOW vulnerability.  
Made for servers which couldn't get restarted yet and didn't have any hot-patch daemon.  
The SystemTap instructions are from the [Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1384344#c13), wrote by Petr Matousek.  

### shorten.sh
Bring any URL shortener in your shell.  
Initially made to work with bfnt.io (using [Polr](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr)).  
You will certainly need to adapt the API, PARAMS and URL_PARAMETER variables.  

### wallet.sh
Simulate a cryptocurrency wallet. Totally useless.
