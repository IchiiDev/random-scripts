# Random Scripts
A few scripts I created when I needed them, or because I was bored.  

### shorten.sh
Bring any URL shortener in your shell.  
Initially made to work with bfnt.io (using [Polr](https://github.com/cydrobolt/polr)).  
You will certainly need to adapt the API, PARAMS and URL_PARAMETER variables.  

### wallet.sh
Simulate a cryptocurrency wallet. Totally useless.
